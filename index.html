          <p class="lead">AI systems are helping businesses become more competitive.</p>

          <p>A new study by researchers at <strong>Zarqa University</strong> reveals that businesses using Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Business Intelligence (BI; tools that analyze data for businesses) to streamline their operations are seeing more overall competitiveness and efficiency.</p>

          <p>According to the research, published in the <em>TEM Journal</em>, companies that incorporated AI into their systems saw a <strong>52% increase in performance</strong>. This is supported by a strong correlation between AI and more accurate decision making.</p>

          <h2>Smarter, Faster Decisions</h2>
          <p>Business Intelligence (BI) software helps companies analyze data, while Artificial Intelligence (AI) predicts patterns and outcomes. When combined, they transform raw data into real-time insights managers can use.</p>

          <p>The researchers explain that this integration allows companies to predict trends, automate analysis, and reduce decision-making time. The combination of AI and BI “leads to an improvement in the overall effectiveness of the organization.”</p>

          <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> AI models analyze feedback and recommend responses and actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Education:</strong> Adaptive learning systems track quiz results and attendance to tailor lessons.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance &amp; Marketing:</strong> Tools manage risk, personalize campaigns, and forecast supply/demand.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These uses show how AI and BI together make organizations more efficient and resilient in rapidly changing markets.</p>

          <h2>Challenges Ahead</h2>
          <p>Despite the benefits, this integration requires high-quality data and strong cybersecurity protections. Additionally, many employees need training to use the technology effectively. Organizations that adapt quickly are better equipped to gain long-term advantages.</p>

          <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
          <p>The researchers conclude that combining AI and BI is more about staying competitive than simply improving software.</p>

          <blockquote>“Integrating AI and business intelligence goes a long way in enhancing organizational effectiveness. These technologies help organizations make timely and more optimal decisions to cope with the fast pace of the market.”</blockquote>
